For young families its very important so select a districts which will provide high quality infrastructure in form of schools, kinder gartens, public transport. In the same time they don't want to reduce quality of life by reducing access to venues like restaurants, pubs, museums, or other cultural venues.\n",

Properties tend to get more and more expensive which maks decisio to pick a district even harder and more time consuming. Also sellers because they set their price too high might also wait too much to finish sale.\n",
